# Project Documentation

## Overview

This project involves controlling various peripherals using Arduino and STM32 boards. The `Documentation` folder contains detailed specifications for the interfaces implemented to control arduino and stm32 board peripherals.

## Documentation Folder

The `Documentation` folder includes:

- **Specifications for Implemented Interfaces**: Detailed descriptions of the interfaces used to control different peripherals on the Arduino board.
- **Future Plans for STM32 Board**: While no implementation has been done on the STM32 board yet, future projects will utilize this board. The specifications provided will guide the development of these future implementations.

## Future Work

- **STM32 Board Implementation**: Although the current project does not include implementations for the STM32 board, it is planned for future projects. The documentation provided will serve as a foundation for these future developments.

Feel free to explore the `Documentation` folder to understand the specifications and planned future work.
