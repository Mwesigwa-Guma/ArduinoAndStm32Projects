# Project Documentation

## Overview

This project involves controlling various peripherals using Arduino and ESP32 boards. This folder contains detailed specifications for the interfaces implemented to control arduino and stm32 board peripherals.

## Documentation Folder

This folder includes:

- **Specifications for Implemented Interfaces**: Detailed descriptions of the interfaces used to control different peripherals on the Arduino board.
- **ESP32 HTTP Server Project**: This project includes an implementation of an HTTP server on the ESP32 board, which also supports over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates.

- **Development Status**: The HTTP Server project on the ESP32 is still under development. Expect more changes and improvements to both this project and the existing ones as I continue to enhance functionality and performance.

Feel free to explore the `Documentation` folder to understand the specifications and planned future work.
